# Interval_Trainer
Max patch that tests your ability to sing musical intervals for ear training purposes.
 
Select which intervals you want to be tested and whether you want them to be ascending, descending, or both. Press "new interval" for the program decide a random root note, interval, and direction within the selected parameters. If you match the pitch of the requested interval, the icon displaying the interval will turn blue. Press "replay root" to hear the root note once again and "play interval" to hear the proper pitches to match.
